* Development framework in which cross-functional teams develop products or projects in an iterative, incremental manner.

**Sprints** _small, clear, relatively stable goal_
* Cycles of work
* _timeboxed_ - end on a specific date whether the work has been completed or not, and are never extended
* collective target from the cross-functional team

## Roles

**Product Owner**
* Responsible for maximising return on investment (ROI) by identifying product features, translating these into a prioritised list.
* In practice, ‘value’ is a fuzzy term and prioritisation may be influenced by the desire to satisfy key customers, alignment with strategic objectives, attacking risks, improving, and other factors. 
* However, the Product Owner is somewhat different than a traditional Product Manager because they actively and regularly interact with the Team, prioritize by working with all of the stakeholders and reviewing the results each Sprint, rather than delegating development decisions to a project manager. 

**The Team** _Development Team - planning, analysis, programming, testing_
* The Team in Scrum is “cross-functional” – it includes all the expertise necessary to deliver the potentially shippable product each Sprint – and it is “self- organizing” (self-managing), with a very high degree of autonomy and accountability. 
* the Team is not only cross-functional but also demonstrates _multi- learning_: each person certainly has special strengths, but also continues to learn other specialties. Each person will have primary, secondary and even tertiary skills, and is meant to “go to where the work is”; 

**ScrumMaster - Project Manager** _Coach and a Teacher on Scrum_
* The ScrumMaster _serves_the Team; he or she helps to remove impediments, protects the Team from outside interference, and helps the Team to adopt modern development practices. 
* Great ScrumMasters can come from any background or discipline: Engineering, Design, Testing, Product Management, Project Management, or Quality Management. 

> The ScrumMaster and the Product Owner cannot be the same individual as their focus is so different and combining them often leads to confusion and conflict.   

**Engineering Manager**
* they support the Team by respecting the rules and spirit of Scrum 
* they help remove impediments that the Team and Product Owner identify 
* they make their expertise and experience available

## Product Backlog 
_prioritized list of customer-centric features_

> At any point, the Product Backlog is the single, definitive view of “everything that could be done by the Team ever, in order of priority”.   

**Detailed appropriately**. The top priority items are more fine-grained and detailed than the lower priority items, since the former will be worked on sooner than the latter. For example, the top 10% of the backlog may be composed of very small, well-analyzed items, and the other 90% much less so. 

**Estimated** The Team provides the Product Owner with _effort_estimates for each item on the Product Backlog, and perhaps also _technical risk_estimates. The Product Owner and other business stakeholders provide information on the value of the product requests, which may include revenue gained, costs reduced, business risks, importance to various stakeholders, and more. 

**Emergent**. In response to learning and variability, the Product Backlog is regularly refined. Each Sprint, items may be added, removed, modified, split, and changed in priority. Thus, the Product Backlog is continuously updated by the Product Owner to reflect changes in the needs of the customer, new ideas or insights, moves by the competition, technical hurdles that appear, and so forth. 

**Prioritized**. The items at the top of the Product Backlog are prioritized or _ordered_in a 1-N order. In general, the highest-priority items should deliver the most _bang for your buck_: lots of bang (business value) for low buck (cost). Another motivation to increase the priority of an item is to _tackle high risks early, before the risks attack you_. 

__Story Points__
For effort estimates, a common technique is to estimate in terms of relative size (factoring in effort, complexity, and uncertainty) using a unit of “story points” or simply “points”. 

> 	The items in the Product Backlog can vary significantly in size or effort. Larger ones are broken into smaller items during the Product Backlog Refinement workshop or the Sprint Planning Meeting, and smaller ones may be consolidated. The Product Backlog items for the upcoming next several Sprints should be small and fine-grained enough that they are understood by the Team, enabling forecasts made in the Sprint Planning meeting to be meaningful; this is called an “actionable” size.

## Sprint Planning
**Summary**: A meeting to prepare for the Sprint, typically divided into two parts (part one is “what” and part two is “how”).
**Participants**: Part One: Product Owner, Team, ScrumMaster. Part Two: Team, ScrumMaster, Product Owner (optional but should be reachable for questions) 
**Duration**: Each part is timeboxed to one hour per week of Sprint.

### Part One 
Part One focuses on understanding _what_the Product Owner wants and _why_they are needed. At the end of Part One the (always busy) Product Owner may leave although they _must_be available (for example, by phone) during Part Two of the meeting. 

### Part Two
Part Two focuses on how to implement the items that Team decides to take on.

> This is a key practice in Scrum: The Team decides how much work it will complete, rather than having it assigned to them by the Product Owner.  

### Capacity Planning
When using the capacity approach, the Team, in Sprint Planning Part Two, calculates how much time each team member has for Sprint-related work. Most teams assume that the team members can only focus on Sprint-related work for 4-6 hours per day – the rest of the time goes to email, lunch breaks, Facebook, meetings, and drinking coffee . Once the capacity is determined, the Team needs to figure out how many Product Backlog items they can complete in that time, and how they will go about completing them. 

### Sprint Goal 
Team scope-flexibility regarding what they may actually deliver, because although they may have to remove some item (since the Sprint is timeboxed), they should nevertheless commit to delivering something tangible and “done” that is in the spirit of the Sprint Goal.

## Daily Scrum
**Summary**: Update and coordination between the Team members.
**Participants**: Team is required; Product Owner is optional; ScrumMaster is usually present but ensures Team holds one.
**Duration**: Maximum length of 15 minutes. 

> It is the Team’s opportunity to synchronize their work and report to each other on obstacles.   

* What has been accomplished since the last meeting?
* What will be done before the next meeting?
* What obstacles are in the way? 

It is a time for a self-organizing Team to share with each other what is going on, to help them coordinate. Someone makes note of the blocks, and the ScrumMaster is responsible to help Team members resolve them. 

If discussion is required it takes place immediately after the Daily Scrum in one or more parallel follow-up meetings, although in Scrum no one is required to attend these. A follow-up meeting is a common event where some or all team members adapt to the information they heard in the Daily Scrum: in other words, another inspect and adapt cycle.

## Tracking Progress during the Sprint
The Team in Scrum is self-managing, and in order to do this successfully, it must know how it is doing. 

### Sprint Turndown Chart

Ideally, this is a _downward_sloping graph that is on a trajectory to reach “zero effort remaining” by the last day of the Sprint. Hence it is called a _burndown_ chart. 

If the burndown line is not tracking downwards towards completion near the end of the Sprint, then the Team needs to adjust, such as to reduce the scope of the work or to find a way to work more effectively while still maintaining a sustainable pace.

## Product Backlog Refinement
**Summary**: Split big items, analyze items, re-estimate, and re-prioritize, for _future_Sprints.
**Participants**: Team; Product Owner will attend the entire activity if they are the expert who can help with the detailed refinement, otherwise they may attend only a subset to set direction or re-prioritize; others who understand the requirements and can help the Team; ScrumMaster will attend during initial sessions to coach the group to be effective, otherwise may not attend.
**Duration**: Usually, no more than 10% of the capacity of the Team for the Sprint, though it may be longer for “analysis heavy” items. For example, in a two-week Sprint, perhaps one day is spent on refinement. 

One of the lesser known, but valuable, guidelines in Scrum is that some ::percentage of each Sprint should be dedicated by the whole Team to refining (or “grooming”) the Product Backlog to support future Sprints.:: This includes detailed requirements analysis, splitting large items into smaller ones, estimation of new items, and re-estimation of existing items. Scrum is silent on how this work is done, but a frequently used technique is a focused workshop near the middle or end of the Sprint, so that the Team and Product Owner and other stakeholders can dedicate themselves to this work without interruption. 

This refinement activity is _not_ for items selected for the current Sprint; it is for items for the future, most likely in the next one or two Sprints. With this practice, Sprint Planning becomes relatively simple because the Product Owner and Scrum Team start the planning with a clear, well-analyzed and carefully estimated set of items.

## Sprint Review
_Anyone present is free to ask questions and give input._

**Summary**: Inspection and adaption related to the product increment of functionality.
**Participants**: Team, Product Owner, ScrumMaster. Other stakeholders as appropriate, invited by the Product Owner.
**Duration**: Timeboxed to one hour per week of Sprint. 

a critical element of the Review is an in-depth _conversation_ between the Team and Product Owner to learn the situation, to get advice, and so forth. The review definitely includes using the actual live software that the Team built during the Sprint, 

The “live software” portion of the Sprint Review is ::not:: a “presentation” the Team gives – there is no slideware. It is meant to be a hands-on inspection of the real software running live, for example, in a sandbox development environment. 

> Sprint Review involves inspect and adapt regarding the _product_  

- - - -
> Sprint Retrospective follows the Review, involves the inspect and adapt regarding the process and environment  

## Sprint Retrospective
**Summary**: Inspection and adaption related to the process and environment.
**Participants**: Team, ScrumMaster, Product Owner (optional). Other stakeholders may be invited by the Team, but are not otherwise allowed to attend.
**Duration**: Timeboxed to 45 minutes per week of Sprint. 

It’s an opportunity for the Team to discuss what’s working and what’s not working, and agree on changes to try. 

Many teams hold retrospectives only focusing on _problems_, and that’s too bad. It can lead to people thinking of retrospectives as somewhat depressing or negative events. Instead, ensure that every Retrospective also focus on positives or strengths.

## Starting the next Sprint
There is no down time between Sprints – Teams normally go from a Sprint Retrospective one afternoon into the next Sprint Planning the following morning (or after the weekend). 

One of the principles of agile development is “sustainable pace”, and only by working regular hours at a reasonable level can Teams continue this cycle indefinitely. Productivity grows over time through the evolution of the Team’s practices, and the removal of impediments to the Team’s productivity, ::not through overwork or the compromise of quality.::

## Managing Releases
### New Product
In the case of a new product, or _an existing product just adopting Scrum_, there is the need to do initial Product Backlog refinement before the first Sprint, where the Product Owner and Team shape a proper Scrum Product Backlog. This could take a few days or a week, and involves a workshop (sometimes called Initial Product Backlog Creation or Release Planning), some detailed requirements analysis, and estimation of all the items identified for the first release. 

### Existing Product
In the case of an established product with an established Product Backlog, there should not be the need for any special or extensive release planning for the next release. Why? Because the Product Owner and Team should be doing Product Backlog refinement every Sprint (five or ten percent of each Sprint), continuously preparing for the future. This _continuous product development_mode obviates the need for the dramatic punctuated prepare-execute-conclude stages one sees in traditional sequential life cycle development. 

Some releases are date-driven; for example: “We will release version 2.0 of our project at a trade-show on November 10.” In this situation, the Team will complete as many Sprints (and build as many features) as is possible in the time available. Other products require certain features to be built before they can be called complete and the product will not launch until these requirements are satisfied, however long that takes. 

Since Scrum emphasizes producing potentially shippable code each Sprint, the Product Owner may choose to start doing interim releases, to allow the customer to reap the benefits of completed work sooner. 

Since they cannot possibly know everything up front, the focus is on creating and refining a plan to give the release broad direction, and clarify how tradeoff decisions will be made (scope versus schedule, for example). Think of this as the roadmap guiding you towards your final destination; which exact roads you take and the decisions you make during the journey may be determined en route. 

> The destination is more important than the journey.

## Common Challenges
Scrum works by making visible the dysfunction and impediments that are impacting the Product Owner and the Team’s effectiveness, so that they can be addressed. 

Eg. the Product Owner may not really know the market, the features, or how to estimate their relative business value. Or the Team may be unskillful in effort estimation or development work. 

The Scrum framework will quickly reveal these weaknesses. 
Scrum does not solve the problems of development; it makes them painfully visible, and provides a framework for people to explore ways to resolve problems in short cycles and with small improvement experiments. 

> Scrum is about giving a Team space and tools to manage itself,
